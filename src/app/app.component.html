                  I have always been interested in real time web applications and web sockets, so as a side 
                  project, I decided to try and implement a real time chat server. I used Anguler 4 for the 
                  front end, and Node.js for the backend REST API's. I utilized Socket.io to implement
                  the real time socket communication between the client and server, so that a user does
                  not have to refresh their page every time a user connects or a message is sent. To store
                  the messages and users, I am using MongoDB. For user authentication, I am using JWT and 
                  I am using the bcrypt library to store hashed user passwords. I am still currently developing
                  this project and making it more robust. I plan to add cases for users to delete accounts,
                  and I am also working on error handling for the cases where users want to create duplicate 
                  accounts. Check out the application at the link below!

                  Code the Change: Queen's Chapter is a club that strives to build free software applications
                  such as websites and databases for non profit organizations. Every year we hold a 
                  "Code Jam", which is an event where computer science and engineering students gather
                  for a 12 hour event, where they work in teams to implement software projects for non profits that are in need.
                  I was the Director of Projects within Code the Change, and it was my responsibility to
                  seek out non profit organizations in need of a software project and develop an idea or a 
                  design that benefit them, which would then be implemented at the annual "Code Jam".

                  The Queen's Computing Orientation Committee is a committee that works to organize
                  orientation activities for over one hundred incoming first year computer science students. I worked as 
                  the Publications Director, where my responsibilities were to design the orientation website,
                  and the orientation handbook that contained information on the orientation week, schedules,
                  and tips for first year success. I was also responsible for working with the committee to 
                  plan welcome events and educational activities for the incoming first year students.
